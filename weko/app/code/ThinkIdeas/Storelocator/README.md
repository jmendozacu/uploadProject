### Basic

* The default url is /storelocator. So once installed go to www.website.com/storelocator (insert store code if necessary);
* Location in admin is inside content menu > storelocator;
* Name, latitude and longitude are required values;
* Bear in mind that chrome and some other browsers allow geolocation services only via https;

### Import

* The csv file needs to be comma separated and values should be quoted;
* check the sample csv file in in <a href="https://github.com/ClaudiuCreanga/magento2-store-locator-storelocator-extension/tree/master/docs">docs folder</a>;
* name, latitude and longitude are required;
* country field should be the 2 letter ISO code. Example: GB for United Kingdom and US for USA;
* image should be the path of the image which is built from the first to letters separated by slash and then the name of the image. Example: for image test.png the path is /t/e/test.png. The image should be placed in folder pub/media/thinkideas_storelocator/stockist/image/t/e/ (last 2 letters changed of course);
* To make sure your csv file is formatted correctly, you can open it in a text editor. It should look like this (comma separated and quoted values):

![csv](docs/images/csv.jpg?raw=true "CSV")

### Export

* Just click export stores and a file will be saved by your browser on your computer;
